## Overview

Decided to do this challenge to keep improving my JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

  - mobile style first
  - desktop style
  - active states
- JavaScript to animate

### Built with
