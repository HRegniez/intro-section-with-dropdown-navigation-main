## Overview

Decided to do this challenge to keep improving my JavaScript.

### Continued development

-On firefox the header's nav-bar needs to be fixed, elements out of the div

-nav pop-downs badly coded, have to have one js scrpt per pop-down \*styled the pop-down <div> instead of it's contents

-should wrap my 'features' and 'compagny in a div so that the click area is bigger
