## Overview

Decided to do this challenge to keep improving my JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [link](https://hregniez.github.io/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-main/)

## My process

- HTML stucture -done
- SCSS to style
  - mobile style -done
  - desktop style -done
  - active states
  - animations
- JavaScript to animate

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS/CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### Continued development

- revisit animations

- finish readme

- nav pop-downs badly coded, have to have one js scrpt per pop-down \*styled the pop-down <div> instead of it's contents

- should wrap my 'features' and 'compagny in a div so that the click area is bigger

- desktop version on Brave doesn't render well, all elements do not fit the page
